Firmware – ESP32 Embedded Software

This folder contains all embedded firmware used in the project.
Each submodule runs on a dedicated ESP32 microcontroller and performs a specific real-time function such as sensing, coordination, actuation, or data bridging.

All firmware is written using the Arduino framework and communicates primarily via ESP-NOW.
